   heading. If a release deserves separate release notes, we create a separate
   document and this file will have a link to it.

2019-07-02
==========

Monthly user summaries. New model :class:`lino_xl.working.UserSummary`.
Similar to SiteSummary, but per user instead of per site and monthly instead of
yearly.


2019-03-21
==========

Add chooser to site, which only allows sites that the author or end_user are
subscribed to. Added the site field to insert window


2019-03-06
==========

Moved the Noi docs from manuals to the noi repository. Note that these docs are
just the "user docs",  not the specs and API. The specs and API of noi remain
in the book because noi is pilot application for some plugins of the xl (e.g.
:mod:`lino_xl.lib.tickets` and :mod:`lino_xl.lib.working`).

2019-01-03
==========

The :class:`lino_xl.lib.working.WorkedHours` shows a new Lino feature
:ticket:`2726` (Lino views as a replacement for extensible calendar). When we
click on a day to show the sessions of that day, we can now navigate to the
previous and next days.
